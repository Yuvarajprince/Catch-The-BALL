## About

Catch the Ball is a classic arcade-style game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The objective is to prevent the falling balls from reaching the bottom of the screen by moving a paddle horizontally to catch them. Each successful catch increases your score, and missing a ball results in losing a life. The game ends when you run out of lives.

## Features

*   Simple and intuitive gameplay.
*   Score tracking.
*   Lives system (3 lives).
*   Sound effects for catches and misses.
*   Increasing difficulty (ball speed increases with score).
*   Start menu and game over screen with restart option.

## How to Play

1.  Download or clone the repository.
2.  Install Pygame (see [Installation](#installation)).
3.  Run the `catch_the_ball.py` script.
4.  Use the left and right arrow keys to control the paddle.
5.  Catch the falling balls to earn points.
6.  Avoid missing the balls to prevent losing lives.
7.  Press Space to start the game from the start menu or to restart after game over.

## Installation

1.  Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3 is recommended).
2.  Install Pygame using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

3.  (Optional) Place `catch.wav` and `miss.wav` (sound files) in the same directory as the Python script. You can find free sound effects online. If you don't have sound effects, the game will still function, just without sound.

## Controls

*   **Left Arrow Key:** Move the paddle left.
*   **Right Arrow Key:** Move the paddle right.
*   **Space Bar:** Start/Restart the game.

*   Different ball types with varying speeds or point values.
*   Background music.
*   More polished graphics and animations.
*   High score saving.
*   More advanced collision detection.
